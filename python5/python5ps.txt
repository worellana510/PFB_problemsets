a. The difference is that with myset = set() and output it you get each unique individual character in the set. While in the myset2 you get the whole string. 
b. yes it matter in the sense if you're working with a sequence for example yand you may want to count each indiviual nt so the myset = set() would work best instead to myset because that produces a singular element wiht all of your nt's.
c. myset has 3 and myset2 has only 1.
